                The panorama route is a famous route and is very well signposted, so you can do it yourself; or there 
                is also the option of guided tours that are run by local experts who can tell you all about the local 
                flora and fauna. Below is a rough guide on how to see almost everything in one day, if you are going 
                to drive yourself. To begin, you will enter the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve and then follow the 
                signs to “the Three Rondavels” look-out point. There is a small fee to enter (about R200 per vehicle) 
                and there is ample parking when you reach the top. There are also some market stalls, toilets, cafes etc., 
                so you can spend if you want there.

                    of the largest canyons in the world; Due to its proximity to several main entrances of Kruger 
                    National Park, Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve and the whole Panorama Route make a very popular 
                    day trip in the area.

                        are rock formations which are shaped like traditional African beehive 
                        huts, the Three Rondavels form three huge pinnacles of rock rising above 
                        the canyon below. The 3 rondavels give a spectacular view over the Blyde 
                        River Canyon. The entrance fee to the Three Rondavels entrance fee is R20 
                        per person.

                            The result of decades of swirling eddies of water where the Treur River 
                            meets the Blyde River, the tumult of which has caused extensive water
                            erosion over time. The result is a series of cylindrical rock sculptures
                            that look as though they would be more comfortable on the moon.The potholes 
                            are located 35 km north of Graskop on the R532 road. Entrance fee is R60 for 
                            an adult and R20 per child and free to children under 6 years old. You will 
                            be pleased to know that there are braai and picnic facilities!
